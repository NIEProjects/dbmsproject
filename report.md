### Abstract

The music industry of the 21st century is in disarray because of new demands from consumers. Gone are the days of cassettes and tape recorders , consumers now expect to access their favourite music on the fly. To solve this problem, Nanna Radio is developed.

Nanna Radio is a modern way of listening to music. It strives to provide an all inclusive platform to listen to your favourite songs and playlists(using Radio option), discover new songs based on smart recommendations (found through the Discover option) and search songs (using the Browse feature). To add further to the features , the user is greeted by daily inspirational qoutes that are generated at random at the home page. The user also has the option to create his own personal playlist and add/delete new songs to it.

Feasibility study is conducted to determine whether the system is economically, technically and operationally feasible and user friendly. 

The user requirements are analyzed to identify the information needs of the end users, the organization environment and the existing system. The user desires simplification and aggregation of services such as storing favourite songs, listening to songs, discovering new songs etc. The requirements have been analyzed and divided into small modules for easy access.
	
Databases are designed with care to accommodate growth in future. User friendly forms have been designed for data entry.  The system have been developed using procedural design. Number of validation checks has built in to ensure the integrity of data entry.
